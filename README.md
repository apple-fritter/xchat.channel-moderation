# Channel moderation
This is a simple Python script for XChat that adds basic moderation commands for banning, kickbanning, kicking, and ignoring users.

This git is intended to provide the barest of moderation functionality to an otherwise unconfigured XChat install.

> It is likely more advanced users will not find this script of much interest.

## Usage
The following commands are available:

- /ban <user>: Bans the specified user.
- /kickban <user> [reason]: Kickbans the specified user with the given reason (optional).
- /kick <user> [reason]: Kicks the specified user with the given reason (optional).
- /ignore <user>: Ignores the specified user.

To use a command, simply type it into the chat input field and press Enter.
